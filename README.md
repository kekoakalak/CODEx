# CODEx Project

CODEx is an experimental personal project aimed at practicing various web development skills including basic PHP, user registration and data storage using SQL, as well as incorporating JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for understanding how to develop web applications and work with different technologies.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the CODEx project are:

1. **Practice PHP:** Develop a solid foundation in PHP programming by implementing key functionalities.
2. **User Registration:** Create a system for users to register and store their information in a SQL database.
3. **Front-end Development:** Build user interfaces using HTML and CSS to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
4. **Interactivity:** Enhance the project with JavaScript to add dynamic behavior and user interactions.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Allow users to create accounts using a registration form.
- **Data Storage:** Store user information such as usernames and passwords in an SQL database.
- **Responsive Design:** Implement responsive web design principles for optimal viewing on various devices.
- **Interaction:** Use JavaScript to add interactivity, such as form validation or dynamic content.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** Backend scripting language for server-side logic.
- **SQL:** Database management system for storing user data.
- **HTML:** Markup language for structuring web content.
- **CSS:** Stylesheet language for designing the project's visual layout.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language for client-side interactions.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Set up a web server environment (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP support.
3. Import the SQL schema provided in the project to create the necessary database tables.
4. Configure the database connection in the PHP files.
5. Open the project in a web browser to view and interact with the application.
